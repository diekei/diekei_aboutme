- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Arif Maulana
- PhD student at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, University of Cambridge, UK.

- As an evolutionary biologist, I am enthusiastic about integrating genomics with ecological and experimental work to dissect the genetic and genomic basis of polygenic traits, such as behaviour and crucially its functional follow-up in adaptation and speciation. I investigate cases involving recent range expansion and colonisation of species that rapidly adapting to novel habitats. This is my repository for depositing codes linked to my research publication.
